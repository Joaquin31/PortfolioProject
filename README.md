# PortfolioProject
A repository to share all my Data Analysis projects

This data exploration project aims to analyze and gain insights from a comprehensive dataset of COVID-19 deaths around the world. Using SQL, 
we will work with a large dataset that includes information on COVID-19 deaths, including demographics, time-series data, and geographical details. 
The project's goals include:

Data Extraction: Acquiring and loading a comprehensive COVID-19 deaths dataset into a SQL database.

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Utilizing SQL queries to explore patterns, trends, and correlations in the COVID-19 deaths data.

Geospatial Analysis: Geographical breakdown of deaths to identify hotspots and regional variations.

Time-Series Analysis: Analyzing temporal trends and identifying significant events and spikes in death rates.

Demographic Insights: Examining how age, gender, and other demographic factors influence COVID-19 deaths.

Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to visually represent key findings from the data.

Reporting: Summarizing insights and findings in a clear and concise manner, possibly through SQL views or reports.

This project will provide a valuable understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 deaths, helping to inform public health policies and responses on a global scale.
